# AI_prediction_after_rehabilitation.py

"AI_prediction_after_rehabilitation.py" is a python AI script for prediction of the requirement of FIM at hospital discharge with Data at the time of hospitalization.

# Features

This program predicts the requirement for FIM score at the time of discharge with the use of AI.  
    
Simulated data used in the study.

We are creating simulation data for patients who are hospitalized after a stroke.

# Requirement

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
codecs
os
sklearn
pycaret

# Usage

The actual patient data is not attached to this source code for the protection of personal information.
Instead, it generates sample data that experts have verified to be valid.

Download an original data for sample data generation.
On execution of this program. A sample data will be generated from "simulated_rehabilitation_patient_data.csv"

# Note

To compare appropriate AI models and perform machine learning, we used PyCaret, an open source software.

In this source code, we have made PyCaret work up to the point where it can perform compare_models.
